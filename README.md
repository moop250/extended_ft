# extended_ft

## Description

extended_ft is a personal project that im doing alongside 42 that involves expanding upon "libft" with functions that I think could be useful in the future.

## Features

- A larger set of functions that is not covered in the original libft.
- Increase in performance and efficiency compared to the original libft.
- Garbage Collector: Incorporates a garbage collector to automate memory management and prevent memory leaks.
- getnextline: A function for reading from fd's such as files and the stdin & stdout.
- ft_printf_fd: A modified version of my [ft_printf](https://github.com/moop250/ft_printf) project which allows you to chose which fd you want to print to.

## Usage 

To clone the repository use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/moop250/extended_ft.git
```

Compilation & cleanup:

* make: Compiles the standard code.
* make clean: Cleans up object files (.o).
* make fclean: Cleans up all files generated by running make, including the library.
* make re: Does a make fclean followed by a make to recompile the library.

Example usage of extended_ft:

```C
#include "extended_ft.h"

int  main(void)
{
    char **split;

    split = ft_split("test string");
    while (*split)
        ft_putendl_fd(*split++, 1);
    return (1);
}
```
